# dotfiles
Repository for keeping track of relevant dotfiles and configs.

*The repo does not contain private stuff, but my settings are personal and
taylored to me (duh) so there's probably not that much of interest here.
If you want to poke around, you'll probably find the git/ directory most
interesting.*
